Algebraically, if the two original NOR gate inputs are labelled B and C, and they are combined to form A, then we have Q = B + C = A + A = A, which is the INV operation.\\n\\nNote that an INV gate can not be made from OR or AND gates. For this reason the OR and AND gates are not universal. So for example, no combination of AND gates can be combined to substitute for a NOR gate. However, the NAND and NOR gates are universal.\\n\\n2.2.3 DeMorgan\\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting of the Boolean identities are the two known as DeMorgan’s Theorems:===== Document 2 =====\\nBoolean Logic Boolean Algebra Voltage State (positive true) High (H) L\\n\\nTrue (T) False (F)\\n\\n1 0\\n\\nVoltage State (negative true ) Low (L) H\\n\\nThe convention for naming these states is illustrated in Fig. 1. The \\\\positive true\" case is illustrated. The relationship between the logic state and label (in this case \\\\switch open\") at some point in the circuit can be summarized with the following:===== Document 3 =====\\nFigure 2: Table 8.2 from the text.\\n\\nAll of the logical gate functions, as well as the Boolean relations discussed in the next section, follow from the truth tables for the AND and OR gates. We reproduce these below. We also show the XOR truth table, because it comes up quite often, although, as we shall see, it is not elemental.\\n\\n4\\n\\nA B\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nQ\\n\\nA B Q 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\\n\\nFigure 3: AND gate.\\n\\nQ\\n\\nA B Q 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\\n\\nFigure 4: OR gate.\\n\\nQ===== Document 4 =====\\nA + B = (cid:22)A (cid:22)B\\n\\n(or; A + B = (cid:22)A (cid:22)B)\\n\\nAB = A + B\\n\\n(or; AB = A + B)\\n\\nThese expressions turn out to be quite useful, and we shall use them often.\\n\\nAn example of algebraic logic manipulation follows. It is the one mentioned at the end of Lab 1. One is to show that an XOR gate can be composed of 4 NAND gates. From the section above we know A (cid:8) B = AB + AB. Since AA = 0 and BB = 0, we can add these, rearrange, and apply the two DeMorgan relations to give\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\n(cid:17) (cid:16)===== Document 5 =====\\nThis circuitry is based upon the transistor, which can be operated as a switch with two states. Hence, the digital information is intrinsically binary. So in practice, the terms digital and binary are used interchangeably. In the following sections we summarize some conventions for de(cid:12)ning the binary states and for doing binary arithmetic.\\n\\n1.1 Binary Logic States\\n\\nThe following table attempts to make correspondences between conventions for de(cid:12)ning binary logic states. In the case of the TTL logic gates we will be using in the lab, the Low voltage state is roughly 0{1 Volt and the High state is roughly 2:5{5 Volts. See page 475 of the text for the exact conventions for TTL as well as other hardware gate technologies.\\n\\nBoolean Logic Boolean Algebra Voltage State (positive true) High (H) L===== Document 6 =====\\nRecall that the text sometimes uses an apostrophe for inversion (A0). We use the standard overbar notation (A).\\n\\nWe can use algebraic expressions to complete our de(cid:12)nitions of the basic logic gates we began above. Note that the Boolean operations of \\\\multiplication\" and \\\\addition\" are de(cid:12)ned by the truth tables for the AND and OR gates given above in Figs. 3 and 4. Using these de(cid:12)nitions, we can de(cid:12)ne all of the logic gates algebraically. The truth tables can also be constructed from these relations, if necessary. See Fig. 2 for the gate symbols.\\n\\n(cid:15) AND: Q = AB (see Fig. 3)\\n\\n(cid:15) OR: Q = A + B (see Fig. 4)'}\n",
